# This is an exemplification of the accepted YAML syntax accepted by the MpGAP pipeline
#
# The file must contain a header-line with the key "samplesheet:". All the
# input samples must be given nested to this key. Obs: The header-line and
# the nest indentation (two white spaces) are REQUIRED.
#
# Each sample must initiate with the key "id:" listed with a "-". This value
# is what will be used as prefix for outputs. The input keys must be given 
# right after this id key, with the same indent without the "-".
#
# Please read the https://mpgap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samplesheet.html documentation page
# in order to understand how to properly set up and which are the available input keys
# for the samplesheet

# A template (with the correct fields, syntax and indentation) is given below:
