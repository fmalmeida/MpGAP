# This workflow set's up an automated execution for testing the code when a new PR is created
# It uses the head branch name to trigger the execution of the new module or subworkflow ...
#
# For example, if I just created a module for roary, I should name the new branch as roary
# then, this workflow will run: nextflow run fmalmeida/bacannot-compare --roary (the head branch name) [blah blah blah]
