Input files
===========

* path to fastq files containing sequencing reads (Illumina, Nanopore or Pacbio)
* path to Pacbio subreads.bam file containing raw data (Optional)
* path to Nanopore FAST5 files containing raw data (Optional)

.. note::

  Users must **never** use hard or symbolic links. This will probably make nextflow fail. Remember to **always** write input paths inside double quotes.

.. note::

  When using paired end reads it is **required** that input reads are set with the "{1,2}" pattern. For example: "SRR6307304_{1,2}.fastq". This will properly load reads "SRR6307304_1.fastq" and "SRR6307304_2.fastq".

.. warning::

  When running hybrid assemblies or mixing short read types it is advised to **avoid not required REGEX** and write the full file path, using only the required REGEX for paired end reads when applicable. Since nextflow randomly loads inputs, this is said to avoid unwanted combination of inputs while loading all reads that match the REGEX.

  We are currently working in provinding a way to run multiple samples at once avoinding unwanted combination.

Assembly possibilities
======================

The pipeline is capable of assembling Illumina, ONT and Pacbio reads in three main ways:

1. Short reads only assemblies

   + Unicycler
   + SPAdes
   + Shovill (for paired reads only).

.. note::

  `Shovill <https://github.com/tseemann/shovill>`_ is a software that can work with different assembly as its core. The pipeline executes shovill with both spades, skesa and megahit, so user can compare the results.

2. Long reads only assemblies

   + Unicycler
   + Canu
   + Flye
   + Raven
   + Shasta
   + wtdbg2

3. Hybrid (both short and long reads)

   + Unicycler
   + SPAdes
   + Haslr
   + Use short reads to correct errors (polish) in long reads assemblies. See `hybrid assembly strategy 2 <https://mpgap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#strategy-2>`_.

   * - Arguments
     - Required
     - Default value
     - Description

   * - ``--shortreads_paired``
     - | Y
       | (for hybrid and illumina-only modes)
     - NA
     - Path to Illumina paired end reads. E.g. "read_pair\_{1,2}.fastq".

   * - ``--shortreads_single``
     - | Y
       | (for hybrid and illumina-only modes)
     - NA
     - Path to Illumina single end reads. E.g. "reads\*.fastq".

   * - ``--longreads``
     - | Y
       | (for hybrid and longreads-only modes)
     - NA
     - Path to longreads in FASTA or FASTQ formats.

   * - ``--lr_type``
     - | Y
       | (for hybrid and longreads-only modes)
     - nanopore
     - Tells whether input longreads are: pacbio or nanopore.
   
   * - ``--wtdbg2_technology``
     - | Y
       | (when running wtdbg2 with pacbio)
     - ont
     - | When assembling pacbio long reads with wtdbg2, it is necessary to tell the pipeline
       | whether reads are "rs" for PacBio RSII, "sq" for PacBio Sequel, "ccs" for PacBio CCS reads.
       | With not wanted it, consider using ``--skip_wtdbg2``.

   * - ``--corrected_lreads``
     - N
     - False
     - | Tells the pipeline to interpret the long reads as "corrected" long reads.
       |
       | This will activate (if available) the options for corrected reads in the
       | assemblers: ``-corrected`` (in canu), ``--pacbio-corr|--nano-corr`` (in flye), etc. Be cautious when using this parameter. If your reads are not corrected, and you use this parameter, you will probably do not generate any contig.

Hybrid assembly strategy
------------------------

Hybrid assemblies can be produced using one of two available strategies:

Strategy 1
^^^^^^^^^^

By using `Unicycler <https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler#method-hybrid-assembly>`_, `Haslr <https://github.com/vpc-ccg/haslr>`_ and/or `SPAdes <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26589280/>`_ specialized hybrid assembly modules.

.. note::

  It is achieved when not using the parameter ``--strategy_2``

Strategy 2
^^^^^^^^^^

By polishing (correcting errors) a long reads only assembly with Illumina reads. For that, users will have to use the parameter ``--strategy_2``. This will tell the pipeline to produce a long reads only assembly (with canu, raven, flye or unicycler) and polish it with Pilon (for unpaired reads) or with `Unicycler-polish program <https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler/blob/master/docs/unicycler-polish.md>`_ (for paired end reads).

.. note::

  Note that, ``--strategy_2`` parameter is an alternative workflow, when used, it will execute ONLY strategy 2 and not both strategies. When false, only strategy 1 will be executed.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 30 10 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Arguments
     - Required
     - Default value
     - Description

   * - ``--strategy_2``
     - N
     - False
     - | Tells the pipeline to create a long reads only assembly and polish it with short reads.
       |
       | By default, the hybrid modes of Unicycler, Haslr and SPAdes are executed. This parameter tells to excute the hybrid strategy 2 (longreads -> polish) instead of Unicycler/Haslr/SPAdes hybrid modes.

Long reads assembly polishing parameters (also used for hybrid strategy 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long reads only assemblies can also be polished with Nanopolish or Racon+Medaka tools for nanopore reads and gcpp for Pacbio reads. For that, users must properly set the parameters. given below.

.. note::

	 For assembly polishing with medaka models, the assembly is first polished one time with racon using the ``-m 8 -x -6 -g -8 -w 500`` as this is the dataset in which Medaka has been trained on. Therefore, the medaka polishing in this pipeline mean Racon 1X + Medaka.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 5 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Arguments
     - Required
     - Default value

     - N
     - r941_min_high_g360

       | Please read `medaka manual <https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka#models>`_ for more instructions.

   * - ``--nanopolish_fast5``
     - N
     - NA
     - | Used to polish a longreads-only assembly with Nanopolish.
       | It sets path to the directory containing all the FAST5 files containing the raw data.

   * - ``--nanopolish_max_haplotypes``
     - N
     - 1000
     - It sets the max number of haplotypes to be considered by Nanopolish. Sometimes the pipeline may crash because to much variation was found exceeding the limit.

   * - ``--pacbio_bam`d`
     - N
     - NA
     - | This parameter loads the pacbio subreads bam file (one single file) for polishing with gcpp.
       | If user has more than one bam, he/she must first merge these files in to a single one with samtools.
       | Whenever set, the pipeline will execute a polishing step with gcpp. E.g. "some/data/my_input.subreads.bam".

  All these parameters are configurable through a configuration file. We encourage users to use the configuration file since it will keep your execution cleaner and more readable. See a :ref:`config` example.
