## About

[MpGAP](https://github.com/fmalmeida/mpgap) is a pipeline developed with [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). It was designed to provide an easy-to-use framework for *de novo* genome assembly of Illumina, Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing data through illumina only, long reads only or hybrid modes.

## Workflow

The pipeline wraps up the following tools and analyses:

| Software | Analysis |
| :------- | :------- |
|  [Canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu), [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye), [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler), [Raven](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/raven), [Shasta](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta) and [wtdbg2](https://github.com/ruanjue/wtdbg2) | Long reads assembly |
| [Haslr](https://github.com/vpc-ccg/haslr), [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) and [SPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades) | Hybrid assembly |
| [Shovill](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill), [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler), [Megahit](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit) and [SPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades) | Short reads assembly |
| [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish), [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka), [gcpp](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/gcpp), [Polypolish](https://github.com/rrwick/Polypolish) and [Pilon](https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon) | Assembly polishing |
| [Quast](https://github.com/ablab/quast), [BUSCO](https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html) and [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) | Assembly QC |

!!! note "Quickstart"

    A [quickstart](quickstart.md#) is available so you can quickly get the gist of the pipeline's capabilities.

## Usage

The pipeline's common usage is very simple as shown below:

```bash
# usual command-line
nextflow run fmalmeida/mpgap \
    -profile docker \
    --output ./results \
    --tracedir ./results/pipeline_info \
    --input input.yml \
    --max_cpus 20 \
    --max_memory '40.GB' \
    ...
```

!!! quote

    Some parameters are required, some are not. Please read the pipeline's manual reference to understand each parameter.
