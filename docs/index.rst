`MpGAP <https://github.com/fmalmeida/mpgap>`_ is a pipeline developed with `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html>`_ and `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_. It was designed to provide an easy-to-use framework for genome assembly of Illumina, Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing data through illumina only, long reads only or hybrid modes.

It wraps up the following tools:
