    "description": "<p>MpGAP is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. It is an easy to use pipeline that adopts well known software for _de novo_ genome assembly of Illumina, Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing data through illumina only, long reads only or hybrid modes.</p>",
