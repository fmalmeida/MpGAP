    Comments:
    This pipeline contains a massive amount of configuration variables and its usage as CLI parameters would
    cause the command to be huge. Therefore, it is extremely recommended to use the nextflow.config configuration file in order to make
    parameterization easier and more readable.

    Creating a configuration file:
    nextflow run fmalmeida/mpgap [--get_hybrid_config] [--get_lreads_config] [--get_sreads_config]

    Show command line examples:

     --genomeSize <string>                                                      Canu and Haslr require an estimative of genome size in order

                                                                                This will activate (if available) the options for corrected reads in the
